            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Planting trees and shrubs can enhance your landscape, provide shade, and improve air quality. This guide covers the essential steps for successful planting and care.</p>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Tree or Shrub</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Climate and Soil</strong>: Select species suited to your local climate and soil conditions.</li>
              <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Consider the tree or shrubâ€™s purpose (e.g., shade, privacy, aesthetics).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Planting Site</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Location</strong>: Choose a site with adequate space for the mature size of the tree or shrub.</li>
              <li><strong>Soil Preparation</strong>: Amend the soil with compost or other organic matter if needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Planting</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Timing</strong>: Plant during the dormant season (fall or early spring).</li>
              <li><strong>Hole Size</strong>: Dig a hole twice as wide and as deep as the root ball.</li>
              <li><strong>Planting Depth</strong>: Place the tree or shrub in the hole at the same depth it was growing in the container.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Backfill and Water</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Backfilling</strong>: Fill the hole with soil, gently tamping down to remove air pockets.</li>
              <li><strong>Watering</strong>: Water thoroughly to settle the soil around the roots.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Mulching</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mulch Layer</strong>: Apply a 2-3 inch layer of mulch around the base, keeping it away from the trunk.</li>
              <li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Mulch helps retain moisture and suppress weeds.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 6: Staking (if necessary)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Staking</strong>: Stake young trees if they are in a windy location or have weak stems.</li>
              <li><strong>Duration</strong>: Remove stakes after one year to allow natural growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 7: Ongoing Care</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Watering</strong>: Keep the soil moist, especially during the first few years.</li>
              <li><strong>Fertilizing</strong>: Fertilize in early spring with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer.</li>
              <li><strong>Pruning</strong>: Prune to remove dead or diseased branches and shape the tree or shrub.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Following these guidelines will help ensure your trees and shrubs establish well and thrive in your landscape, providing benefits for many years to come.</p>
